# Maths-Kfs my legacy project
my first and oldest project that is still running to the day

<p> What a project. I made this project my first real project to apply my knowledge (PHP Foundmental) in PHP and what I gained. back in time then I didn't even know what OOP meant </p> 
<p> When I was already working on this project one of the local teachers was looking for a developer to create an LMS website because of COVID-19 then I recorded my website and for god knows why he called me back and asked if we could make some changes in the style and after that, we can deploy it  </p>

<p> Almost 4 years or more have passed I am literally at a different level I just wanted to quote</p>

```
Reid Hoffman’s quote — “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.” 
```
<p> It was a great opportunity and encouraged me to continue in the PHP and Programming path.Thank ALLah</p>

## Note

#### The website has gone through a lot of changes based on customer requirements
<p> You can still find the website <a href="math-kfs.com">here</a></p>
